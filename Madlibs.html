        When you walkled outside it was a very <span class="Adjective1">________ </span> day. You thought it was a lot more <span class="Adjective2">________ </span> than yesterday. You looked around and saw many <span class="PluralNoun1">________ </span> playing games. You saw your favorite <span class="Noun1">________ </span> on the way home. To ovoid being chaced by the wild goose, you had to <span class="Verb1">________ </span> home. After ovoiding the goose as best as you could, you were very hungry and thirsty, you got <span class="Liquid1">________ </span> and <span class="Food1">________ </span> for lunch. Next you went with your family to go <span class="Verbing1">________ </span>. You accidentally hurt your <span class="Bodypart1">________ </span> while doing this activity, and are very sad! You could only look forward to getting a new <span class="Noun2">________ </span>.
